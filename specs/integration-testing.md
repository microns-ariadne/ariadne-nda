Location of NDA services (URL)  
aridne-nda.rc.fas.harvard.edu  

Boss collection/experiment/channel for the raw structural image data    
integration_testing/2017_04_06/raw  

Boss collection/experiment/channel for the raw functional image data  
integration_testing/2017_04_06/function_raw  

Boss collection/experiment/channel for structural neuron information (automated)  
a) integration_testing/2017_04_06/neuron_seg  

b) Can IARPA assume that all labels in this channel are neurons for evaluation purposes?  
only the neuron labels returned by S4 can be assumed to be neuron labels, although other labels might be neurons 

Boss collection/experiment/channel for structural synapse information (automated)  
a) integration_testing/2017_04_06/synapse_seg  

b) Can IARPA assume that all labels in this channel are synapses for evaluation purposes?  
yes, all but id==0  

Boss collection/experiment/channel for the functional neuron information containing neuron cell body segmentation or ROIs.    
integration_testing/2017_04_06/function_neuron

Boss collection/experiment/channel for structural neuron information (ground truth)  
a) integration_testing/2017_04_06/neuron_gt  

b) Can IARPA assume that all labels in this channel are neurons for evaluation purposes?  
yes, all but id==0  

Boss collection/experiment/channel for structural synapse information (ground truth)  
a) integration_testing/2017_04_06/synapse_gt  

b) Can IARPA assume that all labels in this channel are synapses for evaluation purposes?
